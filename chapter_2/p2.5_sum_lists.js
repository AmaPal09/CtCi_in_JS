/*
Sum Lists
You have two numbers represented by linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list. (You are not allowed to cheat and just convert the linked list to an integer)

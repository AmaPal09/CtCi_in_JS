/*
Route Between Nodes
Given a directed graph and two nodes (S and E), design an algorithm to find ouit whether there is a route from S to E
*/

/*
Explaination:
Can use BFS or DFS to traverse through the graph.
DFS is simple recursion but DFS will search at least one level deeper than the target node level as it will access nodes depthwise
BFS is a queue so extra datastructure but it will find the path/route faster as
as it will search closer to the starting node first and move away only when and 1 level every time it is necessary
*/

/*
Questions:
1) What happens when no route present?
2) What if target node is not found?
3) What if graph is empty?
